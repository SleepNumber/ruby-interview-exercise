# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. ONLY edit this file and nothing else!
#
# 2. Analyze the person.rb and person_tree_node.rb files.
#
# 3. Parse the `employees` array and create a single PersonTreeNode
#    object representing the CEO (the Person with no `manager`).
#    All PersonTreeNode object's `directReports` arrays should contain
#    PersonTreeNode's for their direct reports...creating a tree.
#
# 4. From the command line, execute 'run test.rb' until the tests pass
# 
#  Feel free to create any additional methods in this file as needed.

def generate_tree(employees)
  ceo = nil      # should be a PersonTreeNode object at the end
  return ceo
end
